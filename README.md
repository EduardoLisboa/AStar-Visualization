# A* Visualization Algorithm

An algorithm to visualize [A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) search algorithm working

The heuristic used is Manhattan Distance (or *Taxicab Geometry*, more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) and [here](https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/manhattanDistance.html))

For the required libraries, see the [requirements](../master/requirements.txt) file.

### To run from the terminal, use the command:
* Windows:
```
python main.py
```
* Linux or Mac:
```
python3 main.py
```
------
## Instructions:
When the program starts, the first left click from the mouse will be the starting point, the second click will be the ending point and all other clicks will be considered barriers.

Clicking with the right mouse button will erase the point you clicked, including start and end.

You can hold the mouse button and drag on the screen both when drawing and erasing.

If you want to clear the entire grid, press **"c"** on your keyboard.

Press the **spacebar** to start the algorithm. When it is finished, you can press **"c"** and try again.
